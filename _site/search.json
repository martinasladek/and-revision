It takes the form of statistical information, apparently about factors influencing productivity.

It seems an alien ship crash-landed on Earth recently, with crucial information aboard. From what we can gather, the aliens are trying to improve their coffee-based society, and the ship contained highly sensitive research on this topic that they want to recover. But why was that information sent away in the first place…?\nWe’ve collected a map of all of the locations of recent reported UFO sightings. The aliens have also provided us with the last known location of their ship, but it’s been encrypted in yet more linear models! We are asking you again for your help to find the ship and help our new extraterrestrial allies."

Our new alien friends were very excited by this progress, but quickly became agitated.\nWe finally managed to get them to tell us the problem, and that’s the bad news: productivity on their planet is being enforced by an out-of-control AI that is determined to prevent them improving their society any further. The vault contains access keys to the AI mainframe, which were sent to our planet to hide them away.\nWhich brings me to the worse news. The aliens tell us the AI has detected the signal from the access keys and has launched an invasion force to recover them. The first drones are only minutes away from entering our atmosphere! We have to ask you for your help once again: we must open the vault and retrieve the keys before the AI arrives, so we can deactivate it once and for all.\nHumanity’s continued existence rests in your hands!
